# Security Centre Device Tagging
## What is it
The tool was created using 100% powershell. This tool connects to the Sec Centre API, gets all your machines and tags them accordingly.
Lots of things hashed out in this script as names are internal etc.
## Why I created it
We have a number of endpoints. Some are PCI, some process sensitive information etc. We needed a way of grouping them. This allows us to do the following:
- Different remediation policies for each group
- Different access rights
- Different incident response priorities
- Basically it makes management easier in loads of ways
## Roadmap Items
- This is working good ATM
